# Flask Input-Output Web Application

## Overview

This project is a simple web application built using the Flask framework in Python. It demonstrates how to take user input through an HTML form, process this input using Python, and then display the processed output back on the web page. This example serves as a foundation for more complex web applications where user interaction and backend processing are required.

## Key Components

- **Flask Framework**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
- **HTML Templates with Jinja2**: A templating engine for Python integrated into Flask for creating dynamic HTML content.

## Project Structure

your_project/app.py
your_project/templates/index.html


- **app.py**: The main Python file that sets up the Flask application, defines routes, handles user input, processes data, and renders HTML templates.
- **templates/**: A directory that contains HTML files used by Flask to render web pages.
  - **index.html**: The main HTML template file that includes the form for user input and displays the processed output.

## Functionality

1. **User Input Form**:
   - The web page displays an input form where users can enter data.
   - The form is submitted via a POST request to the `/process` route.

2. **Processing User Input**:
   - The Flask application captures the user input from the form.
   - A Python function processes the input. This function can be customized to perform various tasks such as calculations, data manipulation, or interacting with external APIs.

3. **Displaying Output**:
   - The processed output is sent back to the HTML template.
   - The output is dynamically displayed on the web page below the input form.

## Setup

1. **Install Flask**:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
Running the Application
Navigate to the project directory:

## Initialization


cd your_project
### Run the Flask application:
python app.py

### Access the web application:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

## Customization
Modify the your_python_function in app.py to implement the desired processing logic.
Customize the HTML and CSS in index.html to improve the user interface and experience.
